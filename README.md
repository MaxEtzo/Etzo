## ETZO Neuralnet framework 

Lightweight homemade neuralnet framework..

Currently only contains fully connected layer + two activations: tanh and logistics. 

Slowly in the spare time more layers would be added: convolution, batch norm, etc. 

Further down the line, implementation on CUDA is also envisioned.. This is (hopefully) just a starting point
